# About

Code Commons provides a physical space for community and collaboration. Join us to share experience, learn, mentor, discover opportunities, and work on your programming projects in the presence of others doing the same.

Code Commons also aims to provide the best aspects of workplace culture for people who are otherwise isolated from other developers. This includes (but isnâ€™t limited to) people working on free, libre, open-source software (FLOSS), and software for public service missions.

## When We Meet

Every Wednesdays from 2-6pm unless announced otherwise.

## Where We Meet

Typically in the main library at the University of Arizona but the exact location can vary from the Data Studio room to the open space in front of Catalyst Studio or sometimes even outside of the library. Chris or Devin will announce if we meet somewhere else.

Parking Lot: Visitors can park at the [Cherry Avenue Garage](https://parking.arizona.edu/parking/garages/visitor-parking/) just east of the library. There are also metered parking spots on Cherry Ave. just north of Fourth St.
