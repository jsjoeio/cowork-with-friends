# About

We started in South Scottsdale when one of our members started meeting up with a friend at coffee shops to get out of the house.

Now we're a group of about 10-12 (mainly who work in tech) friends who meet each week for some coworkin'.

## When We Meet

Usually on Wednesdays for 2-3 hours (i.e. 9-11am) once a month.

## Where We Meet

Typically in South Scottsdale. Now that we have a bigger group, we try to find a place that has a big enough table for all of us to sit together. Example places we've gone to:

- Capital One Cafe at Fashion Square
- Luci's
- Awaken Cafe
